# Neon Race Flash - Game Bot
## 100 Days Of Code: Day1.
  
A bot built to learn and play the flash game Neon Race Flash using OpenAI's [Gym](gym.openai.com) toolkit and [Universe](https://github.com/openai/universe) test-train platform.  
  
  **To-Do:**
  * Improve using [GA3C](https://github.com/NVlabs/GA3C) (current version doesn't train on GPU :disappointed_relieved:)
  * Keep updating/improving logic to better training
  * Explore and implement other RL algos to compare
